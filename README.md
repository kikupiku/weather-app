### WEATHER APP

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Javascript curriculum. 

It is aimed at practicing working with **APIs** and using **promises** as well as the **async/await** keywords.

It displays the current weather in a chosen location and changes its visuals according to the weather conditions and time of day. It allows toggling between the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.

APIs used:
- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Giphy](https://giphy.com)

**Live version of the app is available [HERE](https://kikupiku.github.io/weather-app/)**
